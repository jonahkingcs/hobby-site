        <p class="pt-2 pb-2 text-md tracking-tight text-gray-600 max-w-150 text-left">I started working on SlimeShot in September 2025 after having an idea for an angry birds inspired platformer. 
            I chose to go for a 2D pixel art style to give the game a retro arcade look. Beginning this project got me really excited to eventually have a fully finished game 
            with enough levels and level themes to keep players interested for at least a couple of hours.<br>
            <br>This page shows off my progress so far and documents the different steps I took to 
            get a few playable levels working.

            <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 pb-4">I chose to build SlimeShot in Unity because it is a beginner friendly yet powerful game engine. 
                It's perfect for shipping a polished 2D game to both Windows and MacOS. 
                Unity has a great toolset (Tilemaps, Pixel-Perfect Camera, Rigidbody2D physics, and TextMeshPro) letting me focus on gameplay. 
                I code the gameplay mechanics in C# and design the levels using tile palettes in the scene editor.<br><br>
                The internet is full of tutorials and documentation making learning as I go an easier process than I expected. YouTube videos help me fix one problem at a time and adapt concepts to mechanic ideas I have for my specific game.
                <br><br>
                This image shows off a level which involves climbing the castle while dodging spikes as lava slowly rises. This is currently the fourth level in the game, however I plan on adding more levels before this in the future.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900">Sprite Creator</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 pb-4">I decided to use LibreSprite to create the pixel art for my tile textures. 
                Each tile in the game is 16 by 16 pixels large giving a simplistic look to every sprite. 
                Below is the castle background texture. The most time-consuming part was getting the edges to line up with each other, allowing the texture to seamlessly repeat. 
                This texture is made up of thirty-five 16 by 16 pixel squares, represented by the gridlines in the image.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900">Player</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 pb-4">You play as a happy slime character. Because of the slimy surface, you stick to any wall you touch. 
                To control the character you pull back your mouse in the opposite direction of where you want to travel. The further you pull back, the higher your power is. 
                When you let go you are then slung through the air to wherever you aimed at. The objective is to reach the top of the castle in each level as quickly as possible. 
                Levels ramp up in difficulty, adding in more complex mechanics like moving hazards, and rising lava.

                <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 pb-4 col-span-1 pr-12"><strong class="text-xl">Spikes</strong><br>Spikes can be found on any ground, wall, or ceiling surface. 
                    If you touch them you die instantly and have to restart the level. The hitbox for the spikes is mapped directly to the visible pixels, rather than the full 16x16 square.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 pb-4 col-span-1"><strong class="text-xl">Fireballs</strong><br>As levels get more tricky, fireballs are introduced. These move along a custom path that I can set in 
                        Unity. Sometimes they go up and down, left to right, or in a circuit. Their speed is changeable so depending on how nasty I want the level to be I make 
                        them move much faster.
