                I sure hadn't when I was approached by Korfball players at Birmingham University's sports fair. 
                They convinced me to come along to the taster sessions in freshers week, and after those I was hooked. 
                I joined the 3rd team for one semester and was quickly moved down to the 4th team by the coach after letting too many opponents score. 
                The highlights of joining Korfball for me were getting to meet such a diverse group of people and meet a bunch of close friends after moving to a new city.<br><br>
                This page will give a quick background of the sport and summarise the rules that make Korfball so unique.

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>1. Teams & zones: </strong>8 players per team. The court is split into two zones (attack & defence). Each zone has 2 women + 2 men.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>2. Fixed halves: </strong>Players stay in their zone. You only switch between attack and defence after <strong>every 2 goals</strong> scored.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>3. Marking: </strong>You defend players of the <strong>same gender</strong>.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>4. No travelling: </strong>You can't dribble or take steps while holding the ball. You must pass to move it, like netball.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>5. No physical contact: </strong>Blocking/holding/pushing are fouls. Play the ball, not the player.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>6. Defended-shots: </strong>A shot does not count if it is <strong>defended</strong>. This is where a defender of the same gender is between you and the post, within arm's length, actively contesting.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>7. Shooting & scoring: </strong>Score by throwing the ball down through the korf basket.</li><br>
